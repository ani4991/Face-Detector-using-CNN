Face Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
==================================================

This project was done in Python 3.6
The examples directory contains various test images and the outputs generated by our classifier
The repository contains three python programs: test_network.py,train_network.py,test_single_face.py

Requirements to run:
-> TensorFlow and Keras
-> OpenCV
-> matplotlib
-> imutils
-> numpy

train_network.py:
-> Trains a CNN. Cannot be run now as we did not provide the training dataset(due to large size of the dataset).

test_single_face.py:
-> Tests the test image for a single face. The face should be the SOLE CONTENT of the image. Useful for testing and debugging the model in early stages.
-> Usage: python test_single_face.py --model face.model --image "path to image"

test_multiple_face.py:
-> Tests the entire test image for multiple faces. Utilizes sliding window and image pyramid techniques to detect faces at various locations in the image
-> Usage: python test_network.py --model face.model --image "path to image"
-> Manipulating (winW, winH), stepSize and scale would help to get the best possible output for a given test image.
